/*
C #include

    The include preprocessor directive is used to past code of given file into current file.
    It is used include system-defined and user-defined header files.
    If included file is not found, compiler renders error.

    By the use of #include directive, we provide information to the preprocessor where to look for the header files.
    There are two variants to use #include directive.

        1. #include <filename>
        2. #include "filename"

    1. #include <filename>
        The #include<filename> tells the compiler to look for the directory where system header files are held.
        In UNIX, it is \usr\include directory.
    
    2. #include "filename"
        The #include "filename" tells the compiler to look in the current directory from where program is running.
