Pointer Arithmetic in C
    We can perform arithmetic operations on the pointers like addition, subtraction, etc.
    However, as we know that pointer contains the address, the result of an arithmatic operation performed on the  pointer will also be a poinnter if the order operand is of type integer.
    In pointer-form-pointer subtraction, the  result will be an integer value.
    Following arithmetic operations are possinle on the pointer in C language.
        > Increment
        > Decremetn
        > Addition
        > Subtraction
        > Comparison
