The structure can be nested in the following ways.
    1. By separate structure
    2. By Embedded structure

1. Seperate Structure:
    Here, we create two structure, but the dependent structure should be used inside the main structure as a member.
    Consider the following example:

        struc Data
        {
            int dd;
            int mm;
            int yyyu;
        };
        struct Employee
        {
            int id;
            char name[20];
            struct Date doj;
        }emp1;

        As you can see, doj(date of joing) is a the variable fo type Date.
        Here doj is used as a member in Employee structture.
        In this way way, we can used Date structure in many structure.

2. Embedded Structure:
    The embedded structure enables us to declarer the structure inside the structure. Hence, it requires less line of code but it can not be used in muiltiple data structures.
    Consider the following example.

        struct Employee
        {
            int id;
            char name[20];
            struct Date
            {
                int dd;
                int mm;
                int yyyy;
            }doj;
        }emp1;

Accessing Nested Structure 
    We can access the member of the nested structurer by OuterStructure.NestedStructure.member as given below:
        e1.doj.dd
        e1.doj.mm
        e1.doj.yyyy
