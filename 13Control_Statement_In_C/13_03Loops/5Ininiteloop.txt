Infinite Loop in C:

What is infinite loop?
    An infinite loop is a looping constantly that does not terminate the loop and executes the loop forever.
    It us also called an indefenite loop or an endless loop.
    It either produces a continuous output or no output.

When to use an infiniite loop:
    An infinite loop is useful for those applications that accept the user input and generate the output continuously until the user exits from the application manuallay.
    In the following situations, this type of loop can be used:

        All the opearating system run in infinite loops as it does not exist after performing some task.
        It comes out of an performing some task.
        It comes out of an infinite loop ony when the user manually shuts down the system.

        All the server run in an infinite loop as the server responds to all the client requests.
        It comes out of an indefinite loop only when the administrator shuts down the server manuallay.

        All the game also run in an infinite loop.
        The game will accept the user requests until the user exits from the game.

We can create an infinite loop through various loop structures.
The following are the loop structures.
The following are the loop structures through which we will define the infinite loop:
    - for loop
    - while loop
    - do-while loop
    - go ot statement
    - C macros

> for loop:
    syntax:
        for(;;)
        {
            // body of the for loop.
        }

> while loop:
    syntax:
        while(1)
        {
            // body of the while loop.
        }

> do-while loop:
    syntax
        do
        {
            // body of the while loop.
        }whilw(1);


goto statement:
    We can also use the goto statement to define the infinite loop.
    syntax:
    ex. 1:
        infinite_loop;
        //body statement
        goto infinite_loop
    
    ex. 2:
        A;
        //Body statement
        goto A;

Macros
    We can also create the infinite loop with the help of a macro constant. Let's understand through an example.
        #include<stdio.h>
        void main(){
            # define infiniteMacros for(;;)
            infiniteMacros
            {
                printf("Hello \n");
            }
        }

    In the above the code, we have defined a maro names as 'infinite', and its value is 'for(;;)'.
    Whenever the word 'infinite' comes in a program then it will be replaced with a 'for(;;)'.

Till now, we have seen various ways to define an infinite loop. However, we need some approch to come out of the infinite loop.
In order to come out of the infinite loop, we can use the break statement.
